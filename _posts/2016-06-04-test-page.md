This is a test blog page where we can explore how to embedd images in the blog. 

## Image example 1

Here, I will embedd image from local assets which goes into `assets` directory in project's `root` directory. Choose a specific image, related to particular post. I chose to name the image `test-page-image-1.jpg`, which I will embedd as:

```markdown
![my alternate text](/images/img_bg_1_.jpg);
``` 

![my alternate text](/images/img_bg_1_.jpg);

Ofcourse, you can load images from web as well. Just point to image direct URL. For ex, here is one placeholder image:

```markdown
![my alternate text](/images/img_bg_1_.jpg);
``` 

![my alternate text](/images/img_bg_1_.jpg);

One cool thing about this is the fact that images adapt themselves to the screen size of device. Try to resize your browser window and check for yourself, Have fun.
